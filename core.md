# Beliefs

A persons core beliefs are a deeply personal matter based on how someones life is unfolding.

One may decided to take up an organised religion as what they would like to follow.

This might just be what they personally need at that time in their life.

Same with a person who decides that's not what they want to follow anymore.

The same way an artist goes through different eras.

They may change their appearance, approach to life, art style, and so on.

This doesn't mean that a previous era was necessarily flawed or at fault.

It's a indication of their story and how it's unfolding.

We all tend to think about how we'd wish the world to be.

Everyone uniformly following a certain thing and doing things a certain way.

But it's all chaos. 

People exist in different realities and are on different timelines.

We can still meet on human level to at least have a conversation or get some work done.

Of course there's the issue of power plays in the day to day depending where you live out your human life.

Having a certain mentality up your sleeve can help you rise above the pendulum swing and mitigate certain situations.

There are objective truths and subjective truths.

Objective truths are such as natural law. Subjective truths are true to an individual based on how they perceive the world.
